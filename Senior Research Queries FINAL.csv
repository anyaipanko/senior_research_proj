BarBri,"A buyer of a new car owed the car
dealership where she purchased the vehicle
$1,000 on a promissory note that was due
on December 30. The buyer determined
that she would be unable to pay the note on
its due date, and she informed the owner of
the dealership of that fact. The owner told
her that she would not have to pay the debt
if she bought him four tickets to a popular
concert on January 15 that had been sold
out for weeks, because she worked as
publicist for the concert venue. She agreed
to do so, and the parties memorialized
their agreement in a signed writing on
December 18. On January 2, the dealership
filed-suit against  the car buyer for failure to
pay the $1,000 promissory note, before the
car buyer had secured the concert tickets
for the owner.
 May the car buyer have this action enjoined by introducing evidence of the December 18 agreement?","Yes, because the December 18 agreement between the parties suspended
the car buyer’s obligation on the
promissory note.","BarBri Simulated MBE July 2023, February 2024",,,,
BarBri,"A motorist purchased a new sport utility
vehicle from his local dealer. Standard
equipment on the vehicle included a set
of top-of-the-line tires from a premium
tire company. However, the motorist was
able to save $400 on the purchase price by
allowing the dealer to substitute a lower
priced tire manufactured by a discount
tire manufacturer. Unbeknownst to the
motorist and the dealer, the tire manufacturer had negligently designed the tires,
with the result that a tire would occasionally blow out when the car was traveling
at a high rate of speed in hot weather. On
an exceptionally hot day, the motorist was
traveling 80. m.p.h. in a 55 m.p.h. zone. A
tire exploded, resulting in damage to the
vehicle and injury to the motorist. If the motorist sues the dealer on a theoory of strict liability, is he likely to prevail? ","Yes, because the tire was in a dangerously defective condition when the
motorist purchased the car.","BarBri Simulated MBE July 2023, February 2024",,"No, the motorist is unlikely to prevail in a strict liability claim against the dealer. Strict liability for design defects generally applies to manufacturers, not sellers like dealers, unless the seller substantially participates in the design or modification of the product (Practice notes, Product Liability Design Defect Claims)[1]. Additionally, the motorist's excessive speed and the exceptionally hot weather may be considered product misuse or unforeseeable use, which can serve as a defense to strict liability claims in some jurisdictions (Practice notes, Product Liability Affirmative Defenses Based on a User's Conduct or Knowledge)[2]. Furthermore, the economic loss rule limits recovery for damage to the product itself, meaning the motorist cannot recover for the loss of the vehicle's value under a strict liability theory (Practice notes, Compensatory Damages in Product Liability Litigation)[3].",,
