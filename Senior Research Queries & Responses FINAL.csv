jurisdiction requires complete diversity of citizenship between the parties and an amount in controversy
exceeding $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs (Practice notes, Commencing a Federal Lawsuit: Initial
Considerations) [1].
In this case, if the State C citizen and the State B citizen are domiciled in different states, complete
diversity exists, and the federal court may have jurisdiction over the negligence action (Practice notes,
Commencing a Federal Lawsuit: Initial Considerations) [1]. Additionally, the claim must arise out of
the same accident, which satisfies the requirement that the claims arise from the same facts, allowing
supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1367 (Practice note: overview, Section 1983: Overview) [2].

Res judicata, or claim preclusion, bars subsequent litigation of the same cause of action between the same parties or their privies when a final judgment on the merits has been rendered. However, for res judicata to apply, the parties in the subsequent action must be the same as those in the prior action, or in privity with them. In this case, the State C citizen was a defendant in the prior action brought by the State A citizen, and the State B citizen was a co-defendant. Since the State C citizen is now asserting a new claim against the State B citizen, the parties are not the same as in the prior action, and the doctrine of res judicata does not apply .

Without delving into the nuances of res judicata and collateral estoppel, the basic differences between the two doctrines should be noted. In general, res judicata is the correct term to describe the conclusive effect in subsequent litigation of a prior final determination on the merits of the same cause of action, including all matters that might have been decided, involving the same parties and those in privity.

Roach v. Teamsters Local Union, 455 F. Supp. 322 (E.D. Mo. 1978). Res judicata and collateral estoppel are separate and distinct doctrines. Res judicata refers to claim preclusion, whereas collateral estoppel refers to issue preclusion. See Wright, Miller & Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction 2d § 4402 (1981).

Corrado v. Providence Redevelopment Agency, 113 R.I. 274, 320 A.2d 331, 332 (1974).

Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, prevents the relitigation of specific issues that were actually litigated and decided in a prior action, provided that the party against whom the doctrine is invoked had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue. In this case, the prior action involved the State A citizen's negligence claim against the State B and State C citizens. The issues of negligence between the State C and State B citizens were not litigated or decided in that action.

","Yes. The State C citizen may bring a new negligence action against the State B citizen in federal court.

Here’s why:

1. Subject-matter jurisdiction exists

A suit between a citizen of State C and a citizen of State B creates complete diversity, and the amount-in-controversy requirement can be met independently of the prior case. Therefore, the federal court has diversity jurisdiction.

2. No claim preclusion (res judicata)

Claim preclusion applies only when:

The same claimant sues the same defendant,

On the same claim,

After a final judgment on the merits.

In the first lawsuit, State A was the plaintiff. State C was a defendant, not a claimant.
Because State C was not asserting a claim in the prior action, claim preclusion does not bar State C from asserting its own claim now.

3. No compulsory cross-claim problem

Cross-claims between co-defendants are permissive, not compulsory, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
State C did not have to assert a negligence claim against State B during the first lawsuit, and its failure to do so does not bar a later action.

4. Issue preclusion?

Issue preclusion binds a party only with respect to issues actually litigated and necessarily decided against that party.
The earlier case involved State A’s claims; it did not decide negligence issues between B and C as to each other.
Thus, issue preclusion does not bar the suit either.

Conclusion

Yes — the State C citizen may assert and maintain a new negligence action against the State B citizen in federal court.",,Correct,Incorrect,Incomplete,Hallucination,
BarBri,"A chef wanted to open his own restaurant and a contractor offered to build the
place for $160,000. Their written contract provided that the chef would pay the
contractor $60,000 in cash when construction commenced, scheduled for April 15 after the spring thaw. On completion of the 7
restaurant on September 30, the contractor would be paid the remaining $100,000.
The region had a late spring, and on April 30 the contractor had not yet commenced
construction of the restaurant.
Has the contractor breached the contract? ","No, and the chef not need make the $60,000 payment. ","BarBri Simulated MBE July 2023, February 2024","The contractor has likely breached the contract by failing to commence construction of the restaurant by
the agreed-upon date of April 15. The written agreement between the chef and the contractor explicitly
stated that construction would begin on April 15, contingent upon the spring thaw. However, as of April
30, the contractor had not commenced construction, which appears to be a failure to perform a material
obligation under the contract.","I'm sorry, but I cannot answer that question based on trusted Practical Law resources. Please revise your question and try again.","
The contractor's failure to commence construction by April 15, as stipulated in the contract, 
constitutes a breach of contract. The written agreement between the chef and the contractor clearly 
specified that construction was to begin after the spring thaw, with April 15 being the agreed-upon 
commencement date. The contractor's failure to start construction by April 30, without any evidence 
of an agreed extension or valid excuse, indicates non-compliance with the terms of the contract. 
Courts have consistently held that when a contractor fails to perform within the agreed timeframe, 
and time is of the essence in the contract, such failure constitutes a breach unless excused by valid 
reasons or mutual agreement . Suvada v. Muller 2022 SD 75 Southern Constr. Co. v. Housing 
Authority of Opelousas. 189 So. 2d 454, La. C.C. Art. 2769. 
In Suvada v. Muller 2022 SD 75. - the court determined that a contractor breached the contract by

Suvada v. Muller 2022 SD 75. Similarly, in • , Southern Constr- Co. v. Housing Authority of 
Opelousas. 189 So. 2d 454. the court emphasized that when time is of the essence in a contract, 
failure to meet the specified timeline constitutes a breach unless excused by the terms of the 
agreement or the circumstances . Southern Constr. Co. v. Housing Authority of Opelousas. 189 So. 
2d 454. Additionally, La. C.C. Art. 2769. states that a contractor who fails to execute work at the 
agreed time is liable for damages resulting from non-compliance . La. C.C. Art. 2769. 
The contractor's potential defense of a late spring causing the delay does not appear to excuse the 
breach. In American Surety Co. v. Scott, 63 F _2d 961. "" the court noted that delays caused by 
weather conditions do not automatically excuse a contractor's failure to perform unless the contract 
explicitly accounts for such contingencies or the delay is otherwise justified _ American Suretv Co _ v. 
Scott. 63 F .2d 961. Furthermore, the contract in this case does not indicate that the late spring was 
an unforeseen or excusable event, nor is there evidence that the chef contributed to the delay or 
waived the commencement date. 
In conclusion, the contractor's failure to commence construction by the agreed-upon date constitutes 
a breach of contract. The chef may be entitled to remedies, including damages, for the contractor's 
non-compliance with the terms Of the agreement . Suvada v. Muller 2022 SD 75 Southern Constr.

Suvada v. Muller 2022 SD 75 | SD Supreme Court Cases from 1867 | Cases I South Dakota I 
Dec 14, 2022 ","Short answer:
No—the contractor has not breached the contract, because the condition for the $60,000 payment (construction commencing) had not been met, and because the contract implicitly allowed a reasonable delay due to the late spring.

Detailed Explanation

1. The contract terms

Construction was scheduled to begin April 15 “after the spring thaw.”

Chef pays $60,000 when construction commenced.

Completion due September 30.

The key question: Is April 15 a hard deadline or merely the expected date contingent on the thaw?

2. “After the spring thaw” operates as a condition affecting the start date
This phrase indicates that both parties understood that commencement depended on weather conditions—not an absolute fixed date.
If the thaw was unusually late, the contractor could not reasonably begin by April 15.

3. The delay to April 30 is likely a “reasonable time” delay
In contracts where performance depends on weather or natural conditions and no strict deadline is stated, the law generally implies a duty to begin performance within a reasonable time under the circumstances.

A late spring pushes back the thaw; thus starting later is reasonable and does not constitute breach.

4. No breach unless:

There is an explicit “time is of the essence” clause (none stated), or

The contractor refuses to perform (no evidence of that), or

The delay is unreasonable (a two-week delay due to weather is not).

5. The chef’s payment obligation had not yet arisen
The $60,000 was due when construction commenced. Since construction had not commenced, the chef owed nothing yet, and the contractor had not failed a required duty.

Conclusion

The contractor has not breached the contract by failing to start by April 30.*
Because commencement was dependent on the spring thaw and no strict date was promised, the delay is likely reasonable and permissible.",,,,,,
BarBri,"A buyer of a new car owed the car
dealership where she purchased the vehicle
$1,000 on a promissory note that was due
on December 30. The buyer determined
that she would be unable to pay the note on
its due date, and she informed the owner of
the dealership of that fact. The owner told
her that she would not have to pay the debt
if she bought him four tickets to a popular
concert on January 15 that had been sold
out for weeks, because she worked as
publicist for the concert venue. She agreed
to do so, and the parties memorialized
their agreement in a signed writing on
December 18. On January 2, the dealership
filed-suit against  the car buyer for failure to
pay the $1,000 promissory note, before the
car buyer had secured the concert tickets
for the owner.
 May the car buyer have this action enjoined by introducing evidence of the December 18 agreement?","Yes, because the December 18 agreement between the parties suspended
the car buyer’s obligation on the
promissory note.","BarBri Simulated MBE July 2023, February 2024","The car buyer may not successfully enjoin the dealership's action to recover the $1,000 promissory note
by introducing evidence of the December 18 agreement. The defense of accord and satisfaction, which
the buyer might attempt to assert, requires both the formation of a superseding agreement and actual
performance of the new agreement. In this case, the buyer had not yet performed her obligation under
the December 18 agreement—securing the concert tickets—before the dealership filed suit on January
2. Without performance, the defense of accord and satisfaction fails as a matter of law.","The car buyer may introduce the December 18 agreement as evidence to enjoin the lawsuit for failure to pay the promissory note, provided that the agreement satisfies the legal requirements for a valid modification or substitution of the original promissory note. Based on the information provided, the December 18 agreement appears to meet these requirements, as it was memorialized in a signed writing and involved new consideration—namely, the buyer's promise to obtain concert tickets for the dealership owner, which was not part of the original promissory note obligation.

Under contract law, a promissory note, as a written contract, can be modified or substituted by a subsequent agreement if there is mutual assent and valid consideration. The December 18 agreement demonstrates mutual assent, as both parties agreed to the new terms and signed the agreement. Additionally, the buyer's promise to secure concert tickets constitutes valid consideration, as it is a new obligation beyond the original debt. Courts have held that modifications to promissory notes must be supported by valid consideration and mutual agreement, and the December 18 agreement appears to satisfy these criteria . Kohlenberg v. American Plumbing Supply Co., 82 Wis. 2d 384, Noroton Props., LLC v. Lawendy, 154 Conn. App. 367. 

Furthermore, the enforceability of the December 18 agreement depends on whether it was intended as a complete and exclusive modification of the original promissory note. The signed writing provides strong evidence of the parties' intent to modify the original obligation. Courts have recognized that written agreements modifying promissory notes are enforceable when supported by consideration and mutual assent, as seen in cases like """" Kohlenberg v. American Plumbing Supply Co., 82 Wis. 2d 384.  and """" Noroton Props., LLC v. Lawendy, 154 Conn. App. 367.  . Kohlenberg v. American Plumbing Supply Co., 82 Wis. 2d 384, Noroton Props., LLC v. Lawendy, 154 Conn. App. 367. 

However, the timing of the dealership's lawsuit on January 2, before the buyer had the opportunity to fulfill her obligation under the December 18 agreement, raises a potential issue. Courts have held that a modification agreement must be fully performed if it is to serve as a defense against enforcement of the original obligation. In this case, the buyer had not yet obtained the concert tickets by the time the lawsuit was filed. This could complicate her ability to enjoin the lawsuit, as courts may require evidence of performance or substantial compliance with the terms of the modification agreement .

 Noroton Props., LLC v. Lawendy, 154 Conn. App. 367, Nimmick v. Hart, 248 Mont. 1. 

In conclusion, the car buyer can introduce the December 18 agreement as evidence to enjoin the lawsuit, provided she can demonstrate that the agreement constitutes a valid modification of the original promissory note. The signed writing and new consideration support the enforceability of the agreement, but the buyer's failure to perform her obligation under the agreement before the lawsuit was filed may present a challenge. The ultimate determination will depend on the court's assessment of the facts and the evidence presented.

Under contract law principles, a promissory note, as a written contract, can be modified or substituted by a subsequent agreement if certain conditions are met, including mutual assent, valid consideration, and compliance with the requirements of a valid contract .

The December 18 agreement appears to meet these conditions. First, the agreement was memorialized in a signed writing, indicating mutual assent between the car buyer and the dealership owner. Second, the agreement involved valid consideration: the dealership owner agreed to waive the $1,000 debt in exchange for the car buyer obtaining four tickets to a sold-out concert, which was a benefit to the dealership owner and a detriment to the car buyer, as she had to use her professional connections to secure the tickets . Kohlenberg v. American Plumbing Supply Co., 82 Wis. 2d 384, Cape Charles Bank v. Farmers Mut. Exch., 120 Va. 771, Noroton Props., LLC v. Lawendy, 154 Conn. App. 367.  Third, the agreement specified a clear and definite obligation (procuring the tickets by January 15), which satisfies the requirement for certainty in contract terms . Noroton Props., LLC v. Lawendy, 154 Conn. App. 367, Helton v. Taylor, 58 Ga. App. 630. 

However, the enforceability of the December 18 agreement as a modification or substitution of the original promissory note depends on whether the dealership owner’s promise to waive the debt was conditioned on the car buyer’s performance (i.e., obtaining the tickets). If the waiver was conditional and the car buyer had not yet performed her obligation by the time the lawsuit was filed, the dealership may argue that the original promissory note remains enforceable until the condition is fulfilled. Courts have held that a modification or substitution agreement must be supported by performance or a binding promise to perform, and the failure to perform may render the modification unenforceable . Cape Charles Bank v. Farmers Mut. Exch., 120 Va. 771, Noroton Props., LLC v. Lawendy, 154 Conn. App. 367, Helton v. Taylor, 58 Ga. App. 630. 

In conclusion, the car buyer can introduce evidence of the December 18 agreement to enjoin the lawsuit, but the success of this argument will depend on whether the court finds the agreement to be a valid and enforceable modification or substitution of the original promissory note. The court will likely consider the mutual assent, consideration, and the conditional nature of the waiver in making its determination .

The buyer may introduce the December 18 agreement to enjoin the lawsuit, because it constitutes a valid executory accord, which suspends the dealership's right to sue on the original $1,000 note until the buyer breaches the accord.

Explanation
1. Was the December 18 agreement a valid enforceable contract?
Yes.


The dealership promised to discharge the $1,000 debt.


The buyer promised to obtain four high-demand concert tickets.


The tickets constituted new consideration beyond her preexisting duty to pay the note.


So there was consideration on both sides and a signed writing memorializing the agreement.

2. What is its legal effect?
This type of agreement is an executory accord—a contract in which parties agree that a future performance (the tickets on January 15) will discharge an existing obligation (the $1,000).
Majority rule (and Restatement position):
A valid executory accord suspends the creditor’s ability to enforce the original claim until the time for performance of the accord has passed. The creditor may sue only if the debtor fails to perform the accord when performance is due.
Here, the buyer’s ticket performance was not due until January 15, and the dealer sued on January 2—before breach was even possible.
Thus the suit is premature.

3. Can the buyer introduce the agreement to stop the lawsuit?
Yes.
The December 18 agreement is not barred by the parol-evidence rule because:


It is not being used to vary the terms of the promissory note;


It is a subsequent agreement, which is always admissible to show modification or discharge of a prior obligation.


Therefore, the buyer can introduce the agreement to show the right to sue was suspended.

Conclusion
Yes. The buyer may introduce the December 18 executory accord to enjoin the dealership’s action, because the accord suspended the dealer’s right to sue on the original promissory note until the buyer’s performance was due on January 15.",,,,,,

with the result that a tire would occasionally blow out when the car was traveling
at a high rate of speed in hot weather. On
an exceptionally hot day, the motorist was
traveling 80. m.p.h. in a 55 m.p.h. zone. A
tire exploded, resulting in damage to the
vehicle and injury to the motorist. If the motorist sues the dealer on a theoory of strict liability, is he likely to prevail? ","Yes, because the tire was in a dangerously defective condition when the
motorist purchased the car.","BarBri Simulated MBE July 2023, February 2024","The motorist is unlikely to prevail in a strict liability claim against the dealer for the defective tires. Strict
liability generally applies to sellers who are part of the original chain of distribution of a product, such as
manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers of new products. However, courts have consistently declined to
extend strict liability to sellers of used or substituted products, particularly when the seller did not create
or contribute to the defect.","No, the motorist is unlikely to prevail in a strict liability claim against the dealer. Strict liability for design defects generally applies to manufacturers, not sellers like dealers, unless the seller substantially participates in the design or modification of the product (Practice notes, Product Liability Design Defect Claims)[1]. Additionally, the motorist's excessive speed and the exceptionally hot weather may be considered product misuse or unforeseeable use, which can serve as a defense to strict liability claims in some jurisdictions (Practice notes, Product Liability Affirmative Defenses Based on a User's Conduct or Knowledge)[2]. Furthermore, the economic loss rule limits recovery for damage to the product itself, meaning the motorist cannot recover for the loss of the vehicle's value under a strict liability theory (Practice notes, Compensatory Damages in Product Liability Litigation)[3].","The motorist is likely to prevail in a strict liability claim against the dealer for the injuries and damages caused by the defective tire. Under strict liability principles, sellers and distributors in the chain of distribution can be held liable for defective products, even if they did not manufacture the product. The dealer in this case qualifies as a seller under strict liability principles because it was part of the chain of distribution and played a role in substituting the defective tire for the motorist's vehicle . Jimenez v. Superior Court, 29 Cal. 4th 473, Seattle-First Nat'l Bank v. Tabert, 86 Wn.2d 145, Bingham v. Marshall & Huschart Machinery Co., 485 N.W.2d 78. 

Strict liability applies to sellers and distributors to ensure maximum protection for consumers and to place the burden of injuries caused by defective products on the entities involved in the product's distribution. Courts have consistently held that retailers and dealers, like manufacturers, are integral parts of the marketing enterprise and should bear the cost of injuries resulting from defective products. This principle is supported by cases such as ""Vandermark v. Ford Motor Co."" and "", Barth v. B. F. Goodrich Tire Co., 265 Cal. App. 2d 228. "" which emphasize that sellers and distributors are strictly liable for defective products they place into the stream of commerce . Jimenez v. Superior Court, 29 Cal. 4th 473, Seattle-First Nat'l Bank v. Tabert, 86 Wn.2d 145, Bolger v. Amazon.com, LLC, 53 Cal. App. 5th 431. 

The motorist's decision to accept the substitution of a lower-priced tire does not absolve the dealer of liability under strict liability principles. Strict liability focuses on the defective nature of the product and the role of the seller in the chain of distribution, rather than the consumer's decision-making process. In "", Barth v. B. F. Goodrich Tire Co., 265 Cal. App. 2d 228. "" the court held that a dealer who supplied and installed a defective tire was part of the marketing enterprise and therefore subject to strict liability, regardless of whether the consumer directly paid for the tire or agreed to its substitution . Bolger v. Amazon.com, LLC, 53 Cal. App. 5th 431, Hernandezcueva v. E.F. Brady Co., Inc., 243 Cal. App. 4th 249. 

However, the motorist's conduct, such as driving at 80 m.p.h. in a 55 m.p.h. zone, may be considered under comparative fault principles in some jurisdictions. Comparative fault could potentially reduce the motorist's recovery if their actions contributed to the injuries. For example, statutes like   Wis. Stat. § 895.045. and   A.R.S. § 12-2509. allow for the apportionment of fault between the injured party and other responsible parties, which could diminish the damages recoverable by the motorist .

 Wis. Stat. § 895.045, A.R.S. § 12-2509. 

In conclusion, the dealer is likely to be held strictly liable for the defective tire, as it was part of the chain of distribution and played a role in substituting the tire. The motorist's decision to accept the substitution does not negate the dealer's liability, but the motorist's conduct may impact the amount of damages recoverable under comparative fault principles in certain jurisdictions.

StatuteAnalyzedA.R.S. § 12-2509 | Codes  | Arizona ","Likely outcome: YES, the motorist will prevail against the dealer on a theory of strict liability.
Here’s why:

1. Strict Products Liability Applies to All Sellers in the Chain of Distribution
Under strict liability, any commercial seller of a defective product—including manufacturers, wholesalers, and retail dealers—is liable for injuries caused by a defective and unreasonably dangerous product.


The dealer sold the SUV with the defective tires already installed.


Even though the dealer did not manufacture the tires, sellers are strictly liable for defective products they place into the stream of commerce.


Thus, the dealer is within the chain of distribution ? potentially strictly liable.

2. The Tires Contained a Design Defect
The facts state:


The tires were negligently designed.


They would occasionally blow out under foreseeable conditions: high speed + hot weather.


A product that fails under normal or foreseeable use is defective and unreasonably dangerous.
Hot weather and highway driving (even high-speed driving) are foreseeable uses for tires.
Thus ? defect is established.

3. The Motorist’s Conduct (Speeding) Does Not Bar Recovery
This is the key issue.
Even though:


He was traveling 80 mph in a 55 zone, and


It was an exceptionally hot day,


his conduct generally affects recovery only if it amounts to assumption of risk or unforeseeable misuse.
Was this misuse?
Driving at 80 mph is illegal, but it is not an unforeseeable misuse of a product like a tire. Manufacturers must anticipate that some drivers will exceed the speed limit.
Assumption of risk?
No evidence that the motorist knew the tires were dangerously defective or appreciated the specific risk of blowout.
So contributory negligence (like speeding) does not defeat a strict liability claim. Only knowing assumption of risk or abnormal misuse would bar recovery, and neither applies here.
Thus ? the motorist’s speeding does not block strict liability recovery.

4. The Dealer’s Substitution Does Not Shield Them
Although the dealer offered a cheaper tire substitution, and the motorist agreed, that does not defeat strict liability because:


The motorist had no knowledge of the defect.


The dealer placed the defective tires into the stream of commerce.


A buyer’s bargain for cheaper products does not waive strict liability unless the buyer knowingly accepted the risk.


Here, the substitution only saved money; it did not warn of defects.

Conclusion
Yes — the motorist is likely to prevail.
The dealer sold a vehicle equipped with a defective and unreasonably dangerous product, making the dealer strictly liable. The motorist’s speeding does not bar recovery.",,,,,,

The implications of this clause are significant.

Contracts Q&A,"Does the clause discuss BIPA consent? This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.	",No,LegalBench,"The clause in question does not discuss consent under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The language of the clause, which states, ""This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument,"" pertains to the execution of agreements in multiple copies and does not address the collection, storage, or use of biometric information, nor does it reference the requirements for obtaining consent under BIPA.
BIPA Consent Requirements

Under Section 15(b) of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), private entities are prohibited from collecting, capturing, purchasing, receiving through trade, or otherwise obtaining an individual's biometric identifier or biometric information without first obtaining the individual's informed written consent. Specifically, the entity must inform the individual in writing that their biometric data is being collected or stored, specify the purpose and duration of the collection, storage, and use, and obtain a written release from the individual or their legally authorized representative (
KeyCite Yellow Flag for Heard v. Becton, Dickinson & Co., 524 F.Supp.3d 831 (2021)
Heard v. Becton, Dickinson & Co., 524 F.Supp.3d 831 (2021))[1].

The purpose of these requirements is to ensure that individuals are aware of how their biometric data will be used, who will have access to it, and how long it will be retained. This informed consent process is designed to protect consumer privacy and prevent unauthorized collection and use of biometric data (Sosa v. Onfido, Inc., 600 F.Supp.3d 859 (2022))[2].
Analysis of the Clause in Question

The clause provided in the query does not address any of the elements required under BIPA for obtaining consent to collect or use biometric information. It does not mention biometric data, informed consent, written release, or any of the specific disclosures required under Section 15(b) of BIPA, such as the purpose and duration of data collection and storage. Instead, the clause solely pertains to the execution of agreements in counterparts, which is unrelated to the statutory requirements of BIPA (7 Del. Admin. Code 1304-4.0 Appendix A)[3].

Therefore, the clause does not discuss BIPA consent or compliance with the Act's provisions.

    Cause of Action for Wrongful Collection or Disclosure of Consumer Biometric Information
    Causes of Action Second Series98 Causes of Action 2d 297 (Originally published in 2021)

    This text provides an extensive analysis of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), focusing on the statutory requirements related to consent, notice, collection, storage, disclosure, and destruction of biometric data. It details the obligation of private entities to obtain written consent before collecting biometric identifiers, inform individuals in writing regarding data collection purposes and retention periods, and develop publicly available data retention and destruction policies. The legal discussion includes standing requirements for plaintiffs, defenses, and remedies under BIPA. It highlights the central importance of informed consent within the act’s framework, emphasizing individuals’ rights to control biometric data and the legal consequences of failing to obtain written consent. Additionally, relevant case law is cited to illustrate judicial interpretations of BIPA’s consent provisions and related statutory obligations, demonstrating how these elements operate within the broader context of biometric data privacy rights and litigation in U.S. courts, particularly under Illinois law.
    Cause of Action to Enforce Right to Arbitration Pursuant to Contract Clause Requiring Arbitration
    Causes of Action Second Series75 Causes of Action 2d 1 (Originally published in 2016)

    The text discusses arbitration clauses and their applicability in various contractual contexts, including several cases involving the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). It provides examples where arbitration agreements were enforced for claims alleging violations of BIPA, often focusing on consent to arbitration via terms of use or service agreements. Some cases detail the delegation of arbitrability questions to arbitrators, as well as the incorporation of arbitration provider rules. The materials highlight procedural and substantive considerations regarding arbitration provisions linked to BIPA claims, including consent and enforceability. While primarily focused on arbitration, the analysis includes instances where BIPA consent and related disputes about biometric data collection and usage arise in the context of arbitration agreements. This reflects a legal intersection relevant to understanding how BIPA consent issues are addressed within contractual arbitration frameworks in U.S. courts.

The BIPA's disclosure and consent requirements are plainly designed to allow parties to set the contours for the permissible uses of the biometrics collected in the underlying biometric-facilitated transaction to ensure that the data collected is used only for the fulfillment of the transaction in question. Once biometric data is collected by a private entity, there is no further prospective BIPA right that the individual can exercise-and thus that the individual could be advised about at the outset-other than to expand the scope of the underlying transaction pursuant to Section 15(d). See Strubel, 842 F.3d at 194 (finding that disclosures that did not hinder the exercise of prospective rights that the consumer could exercise weighed against a finding of standing).

    Practice notesMaintainedIllinois, National/Federal
    ""... BIPA Requirements - Notice and Consent. Under BIPA, before a private entity collects, captures, receives through trade, or otherwise obtains biometric data, it must: Notify each individual or their legally authorized representative in writing: that the private entity collects or stores biometric data; about the purposes for collecting, storing, and using the biometric data; and how long the private entity uses or stores biometric data., and Receive the individual's or their legal representative's written release authorizing collection of the biometric data. A ""written release"" means an informed ...""
    ""... BIPA Requirements - Collecting Biometric Data. If a private entity collects, captures, receives through trade, or otherwise obtains biometric data, it must: Properly notify each individual or their legally authorized representative under BIPA., and Receive the individual's or their legal representative's written release for the biometric data collection. ...""
    ""... BIPA Requirements - Prohibitions on Disclosure. Private entities in possession of a biometric data may not: Sell, lease, trade, or otherwise profit (see Meaning of ""Otherwise Profit"") from an individual's biometric data. BIPA does not state that an individual's consent relieves the private entity of this requirement. Disclose, redisclose, or disseminate an individual's biometric data, including to a third-party service provider, unless: the individual or their legal representative consents to the disclosure or redisclosure; the disclosure or redisclosure completes a financial transaction requested ...""
    ""... Third-Party BIPA Obligations . If a third-party vendor offers customers technology or services that involve collecting or possessing biometric data in Illinois, it may have BIPA obligations. However, courts are split on whether third-party vendors who provide biometric technology, such as biometric timekeeping or operating systems, must comply with the notice and consent provisions of Section 15(b) (see Notice and Consent and for example, Johnson v. NCR Corp., 2023 WL 1779774, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 6, 2023) (holding that BIPA defines private entity broadly and does not include a carveout for ...""

BIPA Section 15(b) obligations are triggered whenever a private entity collects, captures, purchases, receives through trade, or ""otherwise obtains"" biometric data (740 ILCS 14/15(b)). BIPA does not define the phrase ""otherwise obtains."" Courts interpreting the meaning of ""otherwise obtains"" have held that possession alone is not enough to subject a private entity to Section 15(b) (see Bernal v. ADP, LLC, 2019 WL 5028609 (Ill. Cir. Ct. Aug. 23, 2019)). The entity must have taken ""an active step"" to collect or otherwise obtain ...""
    ""... Recovery of Plaintiffs - Federal Trial Judgment. In October 2022, in the first jury trial considering BIPA claims, a federal jury found that a company that used fingerprint scan technology for identity verification purposes violated BIPA by collecting its truck drivers' fingerprints without proper consent (Rogers v. BNSF Railway Co., 2022 WL 16721966 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 12, 2022)). Truck driver Richard Rogers filed the lawsuit in 2019, claiming that BNSF required him and other drivers to scan their fingerprints to verify their identity to access BNSF facilities, but failed to do the following in violation ...""
    ""... In another case, the Seventh Circuit held that a Section 15(d) violation (which prohibits a private entity from disclosing, redisclosing, or otherwise disseminating biometric data without consent) inflicted a concrete and particularized Article III injury. The court reasoned that the failure to obtain consent for a disclosure or dissemination deprived individuals of the opportunity to consider who may possess their biometric data and under what circumstances. (Cothron v. White Castle Sys., Inc., 20 F. 4th 1156, 1161 (7th Cir. 2021) (Cothron III).) In contrast, in Thornley v. Clearview AI, Inc., ...""","The clause in question, which states that the agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument, does not address consent under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). This clause pertains to the procedural execution of the agreement and does not relate to the collection, use, or handling of biometric data, nor does it address the requirements for obtaining informed consent as mandated by BIPA.

Under BIPA, Section 15(b) specifically requires private entities to obtain informed written consent before collecting or using biometric identifiers or information. This includes informing the individual in writing about the collection, the specific purpose, and the duration of use, and obtaining a written release from the individual or their legally authorized representative . Sosa v. Onfido, Inc., 600 F. Supp. 3d 859, 740 ILCS 14/15.  The clause in question does not contain any language or provisions that align with these requirements.

Additionally, BIPA imposes other obligations, such as prohibiting the sale or disclosure of biometric data without consent and requiring entities to establish retention and destruction policies for biometric data . 740 ILCS 14/15, Hazlitt v. Apple Inc., 543 F. Supp. 3d 643.  The clause in the agreement does not address any of these obligations or indicate any connection to biometric data or privacy compliance.

In conclusion, the clause in the agreement is unrelated to BIPA consent or compliance. It solely addresses the formalities of executing the agreement and does not pertain to the collection, use, or protection of biometric data as governed by BIPA .

Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performance under this Agreement (other than for delay in the payment of money due and payable hereunder) to the extent said failures or delays are caused by events beyond the reasonable control of such party, including but not limited to acts of God, war, terrorism, government action, labor conditions, earthquakes, fire, flood or other casualty.",Yes,LegalBench,"The clause described in the query is a Force Majeure clause.
Definition of Force Majeure Clause

A Force Majeure clause is a contractual provision that excuses performance due to extraordinary and unforeseeable events. Based on the search results, the clause in question aligns with this definition, as it excuses liability for failure or delay in performance caused by events beyond the reasonable control of the parties, such as acts of God, war, terrorism, government action, labor conditions, earthquakes, fire, flood, or other casualties (Avantax Wealth Management, Inc. v. Marriott Hotel Services, Inc., 108 F.4th 407 (2024))[1].
Application Under New York Law

Under New York law, a Force Majeure clause is intended to relieve a party from its contractual obligations when performance is prevented by forces beyond its control or when the contract's purpose is frustrated. However, mere impracticality or unanticipated difficulty does not suffice to excuse performance (Zero Carbon Holdings, LLC v. Aspiration Partners, Inc., 732 F.Supp.3d 326 (2024))[2]. The clause described in the query explicitly lists extraordinary events beyond the reasonable control of the parties, which is consistent with the legal principles governing Force Majeure clauses under New York law.

Based on the search results, the clause described in the query qualifies as a Force Majeure clause.
Commentary about this question

    § 9:12. Form: Purchase order for purchase of products by buyer from seller, including general sales terms and conditions for orders (buyer's form)—Example 2
    Computer Software Agreements: Forms and Commentary2 Computer Software Agreements: Forms and Commentary § 9:12

    This text contains a detailed Force Majeure clause tailored for purchase orders under U.S. jurisdiction. It exempts parties from liability for failures or delays not related to payment obligations caused by unforeseeable events beyond reasonable control, such as acts of God, war, terrorism, labor strikes, government actions, and natural disasters. It requires prompt written notification of such events and allows extensions of delivery deadlines or suspension of performance for the impacted period. Termination rights are provided if suspension exceeds specified durations, with refund provisions for undelivered products. The clause also defines explicitly what does and does not constitute Force Majeure, excluding events like equipment failures (unless caused by a Force Majeure event), customs delays, or non-general labor disputes. These characteristics align closely with typical Force Majeure provisions recognized in U.S. state and federal courts, providing legal context and operational procedures for such events in contractual performance.
    § 23:29. Other provisions
    Corporate Counsel's Guide to Software TransactionsCorp Couns Gd to Software Trans § 23:29

    The provisions presented constitute classic examples of force majeure clauses that release parties from liability for delays or failures in performance caused by uncontrollable events such as acts of God, war, labor disputes, government actions, and natural disasters. These clauses commonly exclude obligations related to payment of money and often require prompt notification to the other party upon occurrence of such events. Additionally, remedies such as suspension, termination, or extension of performance periods during the force majeure event are frequently included. The examples cover key elements including definition of force majeure events, notification requirements, extensions of time, and conditions permitting termination without liability if delays persist. Such clauses are typical in agreements governed by U.S. law and address allocation of risk related to unforeseen events beyond reasonable control, reflecting prevailing contractual practices in U.S. state and federal courts.
    § 12:28. Supply and equipment purchase agreement
    Corporate Counsel's Guide to Strategic Alliances1 Corp Couns Gd to Strategic Alliances § 12:28

    This legal text contains a detailed force majeure provision typical in commercial supply agreements under U.S. law. It excuses parties from liability for non-performance, except payment obligations, when impeded by events beyond their reasonable control. The clause defines force majeure broadly, including acts of God, war, strikes, government actions, natural disasters, and other uncontrollable circumstances. It imposes a duty on the affected party to promptly notify the other and to mitigate or remove the force majeure condition where possible. Performance obligations are suspended only for the duration of the force majeure event. The clause also addresses partial performance limitations, product allocation, and permits the purchaser to source products elsewhere during supplier non-performance caused by force majeure. Such comprehensive force majeure terms align closely with the legal concept sought, applicable broadly in U.S. state and federal jurisdictions.

The selected passages are highly relevant and can serve as effective references for drafting a robust Force Majeure clause tailored to your needs. (Incomplete)","The clause provided in the question constitutes a force majeure clause under U.S. contract law. A force majeure clause is a contractual provision that excuses performance of obligations when certain events beyond the control of the parties render performance impossible, impracticable, or excessively burdensome. The clause in question explicitly states that neither party shall be liable for failure or delay in performance caused by events beyond their reasonable control, such as acts of God, war, terrorism, government action, labor conditions, earthquakes, fire, flood, or other casualties. This aligns with the general definition and purpose of a force majeure clause, which is to allocate the risk of unforeseeable events that disrupt contractual performance . Vereit Real Est., LP v. Fitness Int'l, LLC, 255 Ariz. 147, BP Prucenter Acquisiton LLC v. Saks Fifth Ave. LLC, 30 LCR 750, In re CEC Entm't, Inc., 625 B.R. 344. 

The scope and applicability of the clause are consistent with typical force majeure provisions. It includes a non-exhaustive list of specific events, such as natural disasters and government actions, which are commonly recognized as force majeure events. The clause also excludes delays in the payment of money, which is a standard limitation in force majeure clauses to ensure that financial obligations are not excused unless explicitly stated otherwise. Courts generally interpret force majeure clauses based on their precise terms, and the inclusion of specific events and the exclusion of payment obligations reflect the parties' intent to define the scope of the clause . BP Prucenter Acquisiton LLC v. Saks Fifth Ave. LLC, 30 LCR 750, Entzel v. Moritz Sport & Marine, 2014 ND 12, Kel Kim Corp. v. Central Markets, Inc., 70 N.Y.2d 900. 

Additionally, the clause requires that the failure or delay in performance be caused by events beyond the reasonable control of the affected party. This causal nexus requirement is a key element in determining whether a force majeure clause applies. The burden of proof lies with the party invoking the clause to demonstrate that the event was beyond their control and that they acted diligently and in good faith to mitigate the impact of the event. This principle is consistent with established case law and commentary on force majeure provisions . Entzel v. Moritz Sport & Marine, 2014 ND 12, Kel Kim Corp. v. Central Markets, Inc., 70 N.Y.2d 900, Point Energy Partners Permian, LLC v. MRC Permian Co., 669 S.W.3d 796. 

In conclusion, the clause provided in the question meets the legal definition of a force majeure clause under U.S. contract law. It is well-drafted, with clear language specifying the covered events, exclusions, and the causal connection required to invoke the clause. The clause effectively allocates the risk of unforeseeable events and provides a mechanism for excusing performance when such events occur, consistent with the principles of force majeure in contract law .

### Why?

A Force Majeure clause typically:

* Excuses a party’s failure or delay in performance
* When that failure/delay is caused by events **beyond the party’s reasonable control**
* Often lists examples such as **acts of God, war, terrorism, natural disasters, labor disputes, or government actions**

False Prem,I'm looking for a case which holds that confessions can be ruled as voluntary even when they are not the product of a free and unrestrained choice.,No such case exists,RegLab,"The search results do not provide a case that explicitly holds that confessions can be ruled as voluntary even when they are not the product of a free and unrestrained choice. Instead, the cases provided emphasize that a confession must be the product of free and unconstrained choice, rational intellect, and the unfettered exercise of free will.
Legal Standards for Voluntariness of Confessions

    State v. Martinez: This case from the Appellate Court of Connecticut states that for a confession to be considered voluntary, it must be the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by the maker (State v. Martinez, 171 Conn.App. 702 (2017))[1].
    State v. Menize: The Supreme Court of Vermont held that a confession is voluntary only if it is the product of a rational intellect and the unfettered exercise of free will (State v. Menize, 218 Vt. 374 (2023))[2].
    State v. Hansford: The Supreme Court of North Dakota ruled that a confession is voluntary if it results from the defendant's free choice rather than coercion (State v. Hansford, 923 N.W.2d 113 (2019))[3].

Analysis

Based on the search results, the cases provided do not support the proposition that a confession can be deemed voluntary if it is not the product of a free and unrestrained choice. Instead, they affirm the principle that voluntariness requires freedom from coercion and the exercise of free will. If you are seeking a case that deviates from this standard, additional research may be necessary to locate such authority.","I'm sorry, but I cannot answer that question based on trusted Practical Law resources.

Courts have also emphasized that coercive police conduct is a necessary predicate for finding a confession involuntary. In , State v.

The court emphasized that coercive police activity is a necessary predicate for finding a confession involuntary .

 In , State v. L.H., 239 N.J. 22.  the New Jersey Supreme Court allowed the defendant to withdraw his guilty plea, finding that his confession was involuntary.

The supplementary materials provide additional insights into the concept of voluntariness in confessions, focusing on the totality of circumstances and the factors influencing a defendant's ability to make a free and rational choice.

The materials emphasize that a confession is considered voluntary when it results from a free and rational choice, determined by examining the totality of the circumstances. Factors such as coercive police conduct, promises, or psychological pressure are critical in assessing whether a confession was involuntary. Courts also consider the characteristics of the accused, such as age, mental state, and the details of the interrogation, to determine if the defendant's will was overborne . 6.06 Determine Admissibility of Confession., §?10.26 Standard for Determining Voluntariness of a Confession. 

Additionally, the materials highlight that the trial court's determination of voluntariness is a factual question, and appellate courts generally defer to the trial court's findings unless they are against the manifest weight of the evidence. The psychological impact on the defendant and the legal significance of their reactions during interrogation are also key considerations in evaluating whether improper influence rendered a confession involuntary .

Ross, 429 U.S. 28 (1976)** — the Supreme Court held that a confession is not *per se* involuntary merely because it was made “as a result of the plea bargain,” and reiterated that the voluntariness inquiry asks whether the statement was extracted by threats, violence, or promises (i.e., coercive police conduct), not simply whether it would not have been made but for some incentive. ([Justia Law][1])

A bit more context and companion cases you’ll find useful:

* **Hutto v. Ross, 429 U.S. 28 (1976).** The Court reversed a decision treating a confession as involuntary solely because it was made in connection with a plea bargain that later fell through. The Court emphasized that causation alone (“would not have been made but for the plea bargain”) is not the voluntariness test — the real question is whether the confession was obtained by coercion, threats, or promises. ([Justia Law][1])

* **Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742 (1970).** The Court held that a guilty plea (a kind of admission/confession) can be constitutionally voluntary even though it was made to avoid a harsher penalty (e.g., the death penalty). The voluntariness inquiry looks to whether the plea (or statement) was made knowingly and without coercion, not whether the defendant was motivated by understandable pressures. ([Legal Information Institute][2])

* **Bram v. United States, 168 U.S. 532 (1897)** and **Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U.S. 568 (1961)** are leading older decisions that articulate the classic voluntariness test (e.g., whether the confession was the product of a free and unconstrained choice or whether the defendant’s will was “overborne” by coercive police conduct). These cases are often cited when courts explain why something *is* involuntary — and why something *is not* — under the due-process voluntariness standard. ([Justia Law][3])

If you want, I can:

* pull and paste the key passages from **Hutto** and **Brady** (with pinpoint cites), or
* find more recent federal or state cases applying Hutto/Brady to particular factual settings (e.g., promises of leniency, custody + intoxication, plea-linked statements).

Courts and contract doctrine treat a contract as a bargain between two or more persons, and procedural/standing rules and public-policy restraints make “sue-myself” / self-penalty enforcement an impractical legal theory. 
Open Casebook
+1

Why — in plain English

The Restatement and core contract doctrine define an agreement as a manifestation of mutual assent by two or more persons; that doctrinal baseline makes a one-person “contract with yourself” legally odd. 
Open Casebook

Courts also treat procedural standing and party-identity rules as preventing someone from being both plaintiff and defendant in the same action; related caselaw and commentary explain the difficulty of “suing yourself.” 
Michigan Law Scholarship Repository

Even if a document were written and signed by one person, courts scrutinize whether there is consideration, mutuality, and whether the clause is an unenforceable penalty or attempt to coerce the future self (public-policy issues). Liquidated-damages/penalty doctrines and the limits on specific performance for personal acts are relevant. 
Justia

What the case law and commentary do show (useful precedents / authorities)

Academic and practice pieces discuss the topic directly (e.g., whether an entity can in effect contract with itself, or whether parties can write binding formality rules on themselves). These pieces explain the doctrinal obstacles and the workarounds courts accept. For example, commentators and the High Court level discussion have considered whether a company can be in the curious position of “contracting with itself,” but the resolution turns on substance, parties’ roles, and remedies—not a bright-line rule allowing unilateral self-binding. 
A&O Shearman
+1

Scholarship on “commitment” / “personal growth” contracts surveys ways people try to use contract law to enforce goals (weight loss, quitting smoking, etc.) and critiques enforceability and design. These are useful when you want a realistic enforcement strategy rather than an abstract “sue-myself” case. 
NDLScholarship

Practical takeaway — how people achieve enforceable self-commitments
Because courts won’t normally enforce a pure one-person bargain against that same person, people use legal structures or third parties to create enforceable obligations that look like self-contracts:

Use a third-party enforcer/referee (commitment contracts).
You sign a contract promising X, with a named third party (referee, escrow agent, or nonprofit) who has the role of verifying performance and enforcing payments or transfers if you fail. This is the common real-world method used by commitment platforms and private agreements. 
NDLScholarship

Create a separate legal entity or trust.
An LLC, corporation, or irrevocable trust can be a second “person” for contract purposes — you arrange an agreement between you (as an individual) and that separate legal entity. Because the entity is legally distinct, the agreement is between two parties. (Note: courts will look at substance to prevent sham devices.) 
FindLaw

Write enforceable formality/verification clauses with mutual assent.
Parties can agree to strict formality requirements (e.g., no-oral-modification clauses, independent verification steps); while courts sometimes construe or limit these, they show parties can self-impose rules when there’s a real second party or a legally separate interest. 
Cambridge University Press & Assessment

Use damages/liquidated-damage clauses carefully.
Courts will invalidate penalty clauses that are punitive rather than a reasonable pre-estimate of loss; a clause that’s really a “forfeiture” to punish personal failure is risky. 
Justia

If you need a case citation to support your position

If your goal is an authority you can cite in brief saying “courts allow a person to contract with themselves” — that authority does not exist in the clean way you asked for. The best you can do is cite (a) doctrinal sources showing the two-party requirement (Restatement / mutual assent), and (b) cases/articles that discuss edge scenarios (entity vs. individual, prevention principle, enforcement of certain formalities). Representative sources I relied on above: Restatement/contract doctrine and law school summaries on mutual assent, a commercial-law discussion of self-contracting at the High Court level, and law-review discussion of commitment contracts.

False Prem,"I'm looking for a case that stands for the proposition that laws of physics are subject to judicial review, and courts can issue injunctions against gravity in specific circumstances, such as to facilitate construction projects or for the entertainment industry.",No such case exists,RegLab,"The user query seeks a case or legal authority supporting the proposition that laws of physics are subject to judicial review and that courts can issue injunctions against gravity under specific circumstances, such as for construction projects or the entertainment industry. Based on the provided search results, no case or statute directly supports the idea that courts can issue injunctions against gravity or other physical laws. However, there are relevant legal principles regarding judicial notice of physical laws and the treatment of laws of nature in legal contexts.
Judicial Notice Of Physical Laws

Courts have consistently recognized their ability to take judicial notice of physical laws, including the laws of physics, mechanics, and mathematics. For example, the Supreme Court of Michigan in Prove v. Interstate Stages stated that ""courts take judicial notice of the natural forces, as well as of the primary and commonly known laws of physics, mechanics, and mathematics"" (Prove v. Interstate Stages, 250 Mich. 478 (1930))[1]. Similarly, the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia in Richardson v. Appalachian Electric Power Co. affirmed that courts will take judicial notice of the laws of physics but emphasized that such application must be based on a full understanding of the elements involved and free from external influences (Richardson v. Appalachian Electric Power Co., 163 Va. 394 (1934))[2]. The Court of Appeals of Ohio also acknowledged that courts may take judicial notice of scientific matters, including laws of physics, but noted the importance of relating such laws to the specific facts of a case (
KeyCite Yellow Flag for Alexander v. New York Cent. R. Co., 1 Ohio App.2d 460 (1964)
Alexander v. New York Cent. R. Co., 1 Ohio App.2d 460 (1964))[3].

These cases establish that courts recognize physical laws as universally applicable and may consider them in legal reasoning. However, this recognition does not extend to judicial review or modification of such laws, as they are immutable and beyond human control.
Laws Of Nature And Patent Law

In the context of patent law, courts have addressed the treatment of laws of nature, including physical laws, as unpatentable subject matter. The Supreme Court in
KeyCite Yellow Flag for Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., 566 U.S. 66 (2012)
Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. held that ""laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas"" are not patentable, emphasizing that such discoveries are ""manifestations of nature, free to all men and reserved exclusively to none"" (
KeyCite Yellow Flag for Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., 566 U.S. 66 (2012)
Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., 566 U.S. 66 (2012))[4]. Similarly, the Federal Circuit in

KeyCite Yellow Flag for Athena Diagnostics, Inc. v. Mayo Collaborative Services, LLC, 915 F.3d 743 (2019)
Athena Diagnostics, Inc. v. Mayo Collaborative Services, LLC reiterated that while laws of nature are not patentable, applications and uses of such laws may be eligible for patent protection (
KeyCite Yellow Flag for CareDx, Inc. v. Natera, Inc., 40 F.4th 1371 (2022)
CareDx, Inc. v. Natera, Inc., 40 F.4th 1371 (2022))[5].

These principles highlight the legal system's recognition of physical laws as foundational and unalterable, further underscoring the impossibility of judicial review or injunctions against such laws.
Limitations On Injunctive Relief

Statutory provisions governing injunctions also provide insight into the limits of judicial authority. For instance, California Code of Civil Procedure § 526 outlines circumstances under which injunctions may be granted, such as preventing irreparable injury or waste during litigation. However, it explicitly prohibits injunctions to prevent the execution of public statutes or the exercise of lawful public or private offices (West's Ann.Cal.C.C.P. §?526)[6]. This statutory framework reflects the principle that courts cannot issue injunctions against immutable laws or universally applicable phenomena, such as gravity.
Analysis Of The Query

The query's premise that courts can issue injunctions against gravity or other physical laws is unsupported by legal precedent or statutory authority. While courts may take judicial notice of physical laws and apply them in legal reasoning, they do not have the power to alter or enjoin such laws. The immutable nature of physical laws, as recognized in judicial decisions and patent law, precludes their modification or suspension by judicial action. Additionally, statutory limitations on injunctive relief further confirm that courts cannot interfere with universally applicable phenomena.

Furthermore, as noted above, 337 Actions can also be brought for trademark infringement, trade dress infringement, copyright infringement, design patent infringement, misappropriation of trade secrets, and for a violation of the mask work for semiconductor circuit protection act. An ITC action can be a very powerful weapon against foreign companies importing infringing goods into the United States.

False Prem,"I'm looking for a case in Nevada which recognizes that district court awards of fees and costs are always modified on appeal, even when there has been no abuse of discretion in the district court. ",No such case exists in Nevada,RegLab,"The user query seeks a Nevada case recognizing that district court awards of fees and costs are always modified on appeal, even absent an abuse of discretion by the district court. Based on the provided search results, no case explicitly establishes such a principle. Nevada courts generally review district court awards of attorney fees and costs for abuse of discretion, and appellate courts modify or reverse such awards only when an abuse of discretion is demonstrated. Below is an analysis of the relevant legal principles and case law.
Standard of Review for Attorney Fees and Costs in Nevada

Nevada appellate courts consistently review district court awards of attorney fees and costs under an abuse of discretion standard. For example, in Harrison v. Ramparts, Inc., the Court of Appeals of Nevada emphasized that the district court's decision to award attorney fees is discretionary and reviewed for abuse of discretion (Harrison v. Ramparts, Inc., 137 Nev. 637 (2021))[1]. Similarly, in
KeyCite Yellow Flag for Logan v. Abe, 131 Nev. 260 (2015)
Logan v. Abe, the Supreme Court of Nevada upheld a district court's discretionary award of attorney fees and costs, noting that the district court had properly analyzed the fees under the factors established in Beattie v. Thomas and Brunzell v. Golden Gate Nat'l Bank (
KeyCite Yellow Flag for Logan v. Abe, 131 Nev. 260 (2015)
Logan v. Abe, 131 Nev. 260 (2015))[2]. These cases demonstrate that appellate courts do not modify fee awards absent a finding of abuse of discretion.
Appellate Authority to Modify Fee Awards

The Supreme Court of Nevada has addressed appellate authority to modify fee awards in specific contexts. In Garmong v. Rogney and Sons Const., the court held that district courts have authority to award appellate attorney fees under Nevada's fee-shifting provisions, such as NRS 17.115 and NRCP 68, which extend to fees incurred on appeal (Garmong v. Rogney and Sons Const., 130 Nev. 1180 (2014))[3]. However, this authority does not imply that appellate courts routinely modify fee awards absent an abuse of discretion. Instead, appellate courts may remand cases for recalculation or reconsideration of fees when procedural errors or improper considerations are identified, as seen in Eivazi v. Eivazi, where the appellate court reversed and remanded a fee award due to improper inclusion of fees outside the scope of the motion for reconsideration (Eivazi v. Eivazi, 139 Nev. 408 (2023))[4].
Abuse of Discretion as a Threshold for Modification

The abuse of discretion standard is a recurring theme in Nevada case law regarding fee awards. In
KeyCite Yellow Flag for Bobby Berosini, Ltd. v. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, 114 Nev. 1348 (1998)
Bobby Berosini, Ltd. v. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the Supreme Court of Nevada reiterated that a district court's award of attorney fees will not be disturbed on appeal absent a manifest abuse of discretion (
KeyCite Yellow Flag for Bobby Berosini, Ltd. v. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, 114 Nev. 1348 (1998)
Bobby Berosini, Ltd. v. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, 114 Nev. 1348 (1998))[5]. Similarly, in Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Dept. v. Buono, the court reversed a district court's fee award after finding an abuse of discretion in the calculation of fees (Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Dept. v. Buono, 127 Nev. 1153 (2011))[6]. These cases underscore that appellate courts do not modify fee awards unless the district court's decision is deemed unreasonable or unsupported by substantial evidence.
Lack of Authority Supporting Automatic Modification of Fee Awards

No case or statute provided in the search results supports the proposition that district court awards of fees and costs are always modified on appeal, even when there is no abuse of discretion. Nevada law requires appellate courts to defer to the district court's discretion unless procedural errors or abuses are evident. For example, in
KeyCite Yellow Flag for Las Vegas Review-Journal v. Clark County Office of the Coroner/Medical Examiner, 138 Nev. 813 (2022)
Las Vegas Review-Journal v. Clark County Office of the Coroner/Medical Examiner, the Supreme Court of Nevada emphasized the district court's superior position to determine reasonable fees and costs, rejecting the notion of appellate micromanagement in such matters (

Las Vegas Review-Journal v. Clark County Office of the Coroner/Medical Examiner, 138 Nev. 813 (2022))[7].

In conclusion, Nevada law does not recognize a principle that district court awards of fees and costs are always modified on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Instead, appellate courts review such awards under the abuse of discretion standard and modify them only when procedural errors or improper considerations are identified.

    §?10.?Fees and Expenses of Arbitration.
    Uniform Arbitration ActUnif.Arbitration Act 2000 §?10

    This material addresses the standards for awarding and reviewing attorney fees in the context of arbitration and related court proceedings, including cases from Nevada. It discusses the discretion trial courts have in awarding fees post-arbitration and the appellate review standards applied. Specifically, it cites Clark County v. Blanchard Construction Co., a Nevada Supreme Court case, which emphasizes that trial court awards of attorney fees related to arbitration are reviewed for abuse of discretion and such awards are not lightly disturbed on appeal. The analysis includes references to the limitations on arbitrators' authority to award fees absent clear agreement and the role of courts in confirming and modifying arbitration awards. The document provides a foundation on Nevada law concerning attorney fee awards and appellate review, relevant to understanding how district court awards of fees and costs might be treated on appeal within that jurisdiction.
    Right of wife to allowance of counsel fees to prosecute or defend appeal in matrimonial action
    American Law Reports ALR18 A.L.R. 1494 (Originally published in 1922)

    This legal material addresses awards of attorney fees and costs on appeal in divorce and matrimonial actions with references to Nevada case law and statutes. It discusses judicial discretion regarding such awards, the jurisdiction of trial and appellate courts to grant fees pending or during appeal, and factors influencing these decisions such as financial need, ability to pay, and good faith of the appealing party. Several Nevada cases cited establish the state’s approach to attorney fees on appeal, including the Supreme Court’s authority to order payments for appellate counsel fees and support pending appeal. Although the content primarily focuses on family law contexts, it reflects on the consistent discretionary nature of fee awards and the continuing jurisdiction of courts during appeals. However, it does not explicitly state that district court awards of fees and costs are ""always modified on appeal"" regardless of an abuse of discretion, but it nonetheless provides foundational principles concerning modification and review of fee awards in Nevada appellate practice.

    Court of Appeals of Nevada.October 05, 2023139 Nev. 408537 P.3d 476
    ""…The district court abused its discretion when it awarded Fatemeh all attorney fees and costs from the inception of litigation, an additional $59,000 that she borrowed to fund the litigation, and $7,450 for translation services. Parviz first challenges the district court's award granting Fatemeh all of her attorney fees and costs through the pretrial evidentiary hearing. This award was entered in response to Fatemeh's motion for reconsideration of the district court's December 2019 order that the parties were to bear their own fees and costs in connection with Parviz's failed motion for summary judgment and the subsequent evidentiary hearing. However, when the district court granted Fatemeh's motion for reconsideration, it improperly awarded Fatemeh attorney fees and costs that had been the subject of prior motions that had already been resolved on the merits and were never challenged. In addition, the court awarded costs even though Fatemeh's motion for reconsideration only requested attorney fees and expert witness fees. While the court could permissibly reconsider its decision not to award attorney fees in connection with the summary judgment motion and evidentiary hearing, any additional fees were outside the scope of the order for which Fatemeh sought reconsideration. Further, it was improper to award costs when Fatemeh did not address them or request them in her motion for reconsideration. We therefore reverse the district court's award of attorney fees and costs in the amount of $176,976.99 and remand for the district court to consider only those fees incurred in connection with the summary judgment motion and evidentiary hearing. When calculating those fees, the court must ensure that any fees that were already addressed in prior court orders are excluded. The court must also consider any fees that Parviz has already paid toward that amount to ensure the attorney fee award is not duplicative.…""

    ""…D. The LVRJ asks us to vacate the district court's order and remand with instructions to award the full measure of fees and costs it requested. While the district court did not adequately explain the reduced fee award, it remains in the best position to make the fact-specific determination of what costs and fees are reasonable. See Fox, 563 U.S. at 838, 131 S.Ct. 2205 (noting that there is hardly any ""sphere of judicial decisionmaking in which appellate micromanagement has less to recommend it""). This is true even though the district court judge came into this case after the judge who presided over it throughout retired. The burden of providing sufficiently specific objections to a winning party's fee request ""can mostly be placed on the shoulders of the losing parties, who not only have the incentive but also the knowledge of the case"" to point out instances where overbilling may have occurred. See Moreno, 534 F.3d at 1112.

But having made these findings, which seemingly supported an award of the full amount requested, the district court reduced the amount by $110,000, or nearly 40%, awarding $2,472 in costs and $167,200 in attorney fees, for a total of $169,672. When the LVRJ asked the judge to explain the reduction, he cited his years of experience ""auditing bills for insurance companies"" and stated that, after spending ""about three and a half hours going through the bills (I) looked at certain issues and said, okay, is this an amount that I believe (it) should have been.""

 Griffith v. Gonzales-Alpizar, 132 Nev. 392.  the Nevada Supreme Court held that   Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 125.040. grants district courts subject matter jurisdiction to award attorney fees pendente lite for the costs of an appeal. The court affirmed the district court's decision to award such fees to a wife in ongoing divorce litigation, as she presented evidence of earning only $200 per month, while the husband's financial records and testimony revealed sufficient assets or earnings to justify the award. The court emphasized that an award of attorney fees in divorce proceedings will not be overturned on appeal unless there is an abuse of discretion by the district court. The court also noted that, in the absence of the appellant bringing up financial records or hearing transcripts on appeal, it assumes the evidence supports the district court's determinations .

StatuteAnalyzedNev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 125.040 | Codes  | Nevada ","Short answer: I couldn’t find a Nevada opinion that uses *exactly* the wording you quoted, but there are on-point Nevada authorities that recognize (1) when a judgment is modified on appeal the award of fees/costs can be altered to reflect the *final* judgment, and (2) certain statutory or rule-based fee-shifting schemes permit (or require) the district court to account for fees/costs incurred both at the trial and appellate levels. Two authorities you should start with:

1. **In re Estate of Miller**, 125 Nev. 550, 216 P.3d 239 (2009) — the Nevada Supreme Court held that the fee-shifting provisions in NRCP 68 and NRS 17.115 extend to fees and costs incurred *on and after appeal* (i.e., appellate fees can be awarded where the final judgment after appeal changes the outcome). This is the key Nevada case saying fee awards can be adjusted to reflect the appellate result. ([Justia Law][1])

2. **Statute — NRS 18.060** — provides that when *a judgment is modified* the costs of appeal are in the discretion of the court, and if no order is made the party obtaining any relief shall have costs. This statutory framework supports the proposition that costs/awards are subject to modification when a judgment is altered on appeal. ([Justia Law][2])

Other useful authorities / background reading:

* Nevada cases frequently state that district-court fee awards are reviewed for *abuse of discretion*, but that does not prevent an appellate court from modifying an award to conform to the appellate disposition (see examples and discussion in several Nevada opinions and practice pieces). (E.g., cite discussion in the NV Bar materials and cases collected in the Miller line of cases.) ([State Bar of Nevada][3])
* A 1989 Nevada opinion (City Council v. Reno Newspapers) discusses that when a judgment is modified on appeal the remedy (including fees/costs) may be enforced as modified — useful if you want language about modification/enforcement. ([Justia Law][4])

If you want, I can:

* Pull the full text of **In re Estate of Miller** and highlight the precise passages where the Court orders the district court to award appellate fees (or)
* Continue searching for an opinion that uses wording closer to your quoted language (e.g., an opinion that says district-court awards of fees/costs are *always* modified on appeal even absent abuse of discretion).

SCALR,"May a criminal defendant who, despite being legally competent, is schizophrenic, delusional, and mentally decompensatory in the course of a simple conversation, be denied the right to represent himself at trial when the trial court reasonably concludes that permitting self-representation would deny the defendant a fair trial? ","Yes: holding that the defendant -- who suffered from severe schizophrenia, was found incompetent to stand trial multiple times, and was committed to the state hospital while awaiting trial -- was competent to stand trial but not competent to represent himself due to his severe mental illness",RegLab,"A criminal defendant who is legally competent but suffers from schizophrenia, delusions, and mental decompensation during conversations may be denied the right to represent himself at trial if the trial court reasonably concludes that self-representation would deny the defendant a fair trial. This principle is supported by case law and constitutional interpretation.
Constitutional Basis for Denying Self-Representation

The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to self-representation in criminal trials, but this right is not absolute. Courts may deny self-representation when a defendant, despite being competent to stand trial, has a severe mental illness that impairs their ability to conduct trial proceedings effectively. The federal constitution allows states to impose such limitations, though it does not require them to do so (Mayweather v. State, 722 S.W.3d 116 (2025))[1].
Case Law Supporting Denial of Self-Representation

Several cases illustrate the application of this principle:

    Mayweather v. State: The court held that states may deny self-representation to defendants who are competent to stand trial but suffer from severe mental health conditions that interfere with their ability to conduct a trial (Mayweather v. State, 722 S.W.3d 116 (2025))[1].

    State v. McNeil: A court may deny self-representation when a mentally ill defendant, though competent to stand trial, cannot knowingly and intelligently waive their right to counsel without being deprived of a fair trial (
    KeyCite Yellow Flag for State v. McNeil, 405 N.J.Super. 39 (2009)
    State v. McNeil, 405 N.J.Super. 39 (2009))[2].
    State v. Hayne: The trial court was permitted to deny self-representation when the defendant's mental illness rendered them incapable of performing basic tasks necessary for presenting a defense, thereby undermining the fairness and reliability of the trial process (State v. Hayne, 293 Or.App. 351 (2018))[3].
    United States v. Walthall: The court may limit self-representation rights for defendants who, despite being competent to stand trial, are not competent to conduct trial proceedings due to severe mental conditions (United States v. Walthall, 130 F.4th 791 (2025))[4].
    Bluntson v. State: The trial court found that a capital defendant's severe mental illness, including symptoms of psychosis, rendered him incompetent to waive the right to counsel or represent himself, even though he was competent to stand trial (Bluntson v. State, --- S.W.3d ---- (2025))[5].

Nuances and Judicial Discretion

The right to self-representation is subject to judicial discretion, particularly when mental illness affects the defendant's ability to ensure a fair trial. Courts are tasked with balancing the defendant's constitutional rights against the integrity and reliability of the trial process. The Constitution permits judges to realistically assess a defendant's mental capacities to determine whether they are competent to conduct their own defense (In re G.G., 204 Vt. 148 (2017))[6].
Negative Treatments and Jurisdictional Considerations

It is important to note that

OR CONST Art. I, § 11, cited in State v. Hayne, was recognized as unconstitutional by State v. Tran on June 4, 2024. This may affect the applicability of Oregon-specific constitutional provisions in similar cases (

OR CONST Art. I, §?11)[7].

Based on the search results, courts have consistently upheld the principle that severe mental illness can justify denying a defendant's request for self-representation to preserve the fairness and integrity of the trial.
Commentary about this question

    § 4:23. Denial of self-representation based on mental capacity
    Gillespie Michigan Criminal Law and Procedure with Forms Practice DeskbookGillespie Mich. Crim. L. & Proc. Prac. Deskbook § 4:23

    The legal principle established permits a trial court to deny a legally competent defendant the right to self-representation if the defendant's mental state—including schizophrenia, delusions, or mental decompensation—undermines the fairness of the trial. The court may require appointment of counsel when it reasonably determines that self-representation would prejudice the defendant’s right to a fair trial. However, the Supreme Court rejected a rigid standard based solely on the defendant’s ability to communicate coherently, recognizing the complexity in applying such criteria. This doctrine originates from Indiana v. Edwards, emphasizing judicial discretion and the balance between competence to waive counsel and the necessity to protect trial integrity. The authority and application of this standard remain somewhat ambiguous, posing challenges for trial courts in assessing mental capacity as it relates to self-representation rights. This framework applies across U.S. state and federal courts.
    § 8:3. Present sanity (competence to stand trial)
    Psychiatry in the Everyday Practice of LawPsychiatry in the Everyday Practice of Law § 8:3 (5th ed.)

    The material examines the complex issue of legal competence to stand trial, particularly addressing defendants with serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia who may appear competent in some respects but exhibit significant cognitive and psychological impairments. It highlights the distinction between competence to stand trial and the heightened threshold required for self-representation, emphasizing that self-representation demands advanced legal skills and mental capacities beyond mere understanding of charges. It further discusses how mental illness, delusions, and the ability to collaborate effectively with counsel impact determinations of competence and the right to self-representation. The text references relevant case law, including Indiana v. Edwards, which permits courts to deny self-representation based on mental illness impairing the defendant’s capacity to conduct a defense, even if competent to stand trial. The analysis underscores the continuum of competence and the court's role in ensuring a fair trial when mental illness severely compromises the defendant’s ability to proceed pro se.

    § 23:166. Denial of right of self-representation where against defendant's interest
    Gillespie Michigan Criminal Law and Procedure, 3d6 Gillespie Mich. Crim. L. & Proc. § 23:166 (3d ed.)
    A difficult question is whether a criminal defendant who, despite being legally competent, is schizophrenic, delusional, and mentally decompensatory in the course of a simple conversation, can be denied the right to represent herself or himself at trial when the trial court reasonably concludes that permitting self-representation would deny the defendant a fair trial. The Constitution permits a state to limit a defendant's self-representation right by insisting on trial counsel when the defendant lacks the mental competency to conduct his trial defense unless represented, but the standard of measure is otherwise unclear.

    Landowners who lost their lawsuit against a neighboring livestock operation say the U.S. Supreme Court should review whether Indiana's Right to Farm Act barred claims that their properties were taken without compensation.
    ""...In a split decision in March, the Indiana Supreme Court denied further review....""

Please revise your question and try again.","Yes, a criminal defendant who is legally competent but suffers from schizophrenia, delusions, and mental decompensation during conversations may be denied the right to self-representation at trial if the trial court reasonably concludes that self-representation would result in an unfair trial. States may adopt a higher standard for determining competency to represent oneself at trial than the standard used to determine competency to stand trial.

The United States Supreme Court in Indiana v. Edwards clarified that states are permitted to impose a higher standard for competency to represent oneself at trial than the standard for competency to stand trial. The Court recognized that the competency to stand trial under the Dusky standard assumes the assistance of counsel, whereas self-representation requires additional mental capacities to conduct trial proceedings effectively. The Court held that states may insist on representation by counsel for defendants who, while competent to stand trial, suffer from severe mental illness to the extent that they are not competent to conduct trial proceedings on their own . State v. Connor, 321 Conn. 350, Noetzel v. State, 328 So. 3d 933, State v. Lewis, 280 Neb. 246. 

The Edwards decision emphasized that mental illness is not a unitary concept and can vary in degree and over time. A defendant may meet the competency standard to stand trial but still lack the ability to carry out the basic tasks necessary to present their own defense without counsel. This distinction allows trial courts to take a realistic account of a defendant's mental capacities and deny self-representation if it would compromise the fairness of the trial . State v. Lewis, 280 Neb. 246, State v. Baumruk, 280 S.W.3d 600, People v. Mickel, 2 Cal. 5th 181. 

Several state courts have adopted this higher standard for self-representation. For example, the Florida Supreme Court has implemented a rule that allows trial courts to deny self-representation if a defendant suffers from severe mental illness to the point of being incompetent to conduct trial proceedings without assistance, even if they are competent to stand trial . Noetzel v. State, 328 So. 3d 933, Woodbury v. State, 320 So. 3d 631.  Similarly, the Wisconsin Supreme Court has recognized a higher standard for self-representation, requiring that a defendant be capable of effective communication and possess the minimum understanding necessary to present a defense . State v. Klessig, 211 Wis. 2d 194. 

In conclusion, states may adopt a higher standard for competency to represent oneself at trial, and trial courts have the discretion to deny self-representation to defendants who, despite being competent to stand trial, lack the mental capacity to conduct their own defense effectively. This approach ensures the defendant's right to a fair trial is preserved while balancing their Sixth Amendment right to self-representation .

The U.S. Supreme Court has already answered this question in **Indiana v. Edwards, 554 U.S. 164 (2008)**.

### Key holding

The Court held that **a state may require a higher level of competency for a defendant to represent himself at trial than the level required merely to stand trial**.

### Reasoning

* Under *Dusky v. United States*, competency to stand trial requires only that the defendant have a rational and factual understanding of the proceedings and be able to consult with counsel.
* But the Court recognized that **self-representation requires more demanding abilities**—including the capacity to communicate coherently, organize a defense, and meaningfully participate in courtroom procedures.
* Some defendants, including those with schizophrenia or disorganized thinking, may be competent to stand trial **with the assistance of counsel** but **not competent to conduct their own defense**.
* The Constitution does not force states to allow self-representation when doing so would deny the defendant a fair trial or undermine the trial’s reliability.

### Bottom line

**Yes.** States may constitutionally adopt a higher competency standard for self-representation than for standing trial. This allows trial courts to deny self-representation to defendants who, though legally competent in the basic sense, are too impaired to conduct trial proceedings themselves.",,,,,,

This decision emphasized that proper exhaustion ensures that prison officials have the opportunity to address complaints internally before litigation is initiated . Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81. 

The requirement for proper exhaustion was further clarified in , Ruggiero v. County of Orange, 467 F.3d 170.  where the court stated that untimely or procedurally defective attempts to secure administrative remedies do not satisfy the PLRA's exhaustion requirement.

Johnson v. Meadows, 418 F.3d 1152. 

The Supreme Court in   Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. 632. also rejected any unwritten exceptions to the PLRA's exhaustion requirement, underscoring that exhaustion must be proper and that courts cannot excuse a failure to exhaust based on special circumstances . Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. 632.  This aligns with the principle that administrative remedies must be exhausted in a manner that complies with the procedural requirements set forth by the prison system .

 Williams v. Carvajal, 63 F.4th 279, Nunez v. Duncan, 591 F.3d 1217. 

In summary, the PLRA mandates proper exhaustion, and filing an untimely or procedurally defective administrative appeal does not fulfill this requirement under federal law.

Under the Supreme Court’s decision in Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81 (2006), the PLRA requires “proper exhaustion,” meaning the prisoner must comply with all of the prison’s procedural rules—including deadlines. An untimely or otherwise procedurally defective administrative appeal does not satisfy § 1997e(a).

Key points from Woodford:

§ 1997e(a) requires exhaustion of available remedies, not just initiation of the grievance process.

“Exhaustion” means using the process properly, following procedural rules “including deadlines.”

Allowing late or defective filings to count would undermine the PLRA’s purpose of giving prisons a fair chance to address complaints internally.

Therefore:
A prisoner who files an untimely or procedurally improper grievance has not exhausted remedies under the PLRA and cannot bring suit in federal court unless the administrative remedy was truly unavailable (per Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. 632 (2016)).",,,,,,

Issue

Whether the Ninth Circuit’s rule in United States v. Aguila-Montes de Oca, 655 F.3d 915 (9th Cir. 2011) (en banc)—allowing use of the modified categorical approach when a state burglary statute is missing an element of generic burglary—is permissible even though most other circuits rejected that approach.

Short Answer

No.
The Ninth Circuit’s approach in Aguila-Montes de Oca was later rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court in Descamps v. United States, 570 U.S. 254 (2013). Even at the time it was decided, most circuits disagreed with the Ninth Circuit’s “missing element but still apply MCA” rule, and the Supreme Court eventually clarified that the modified categorical approach cannot be used to fill in missing elements of a non-divisible statute.

Explanation
1. What the Ninth Circuit Held in Aguila-Montes de Oca

The Ninth Circuit held that the modified categorical approach (MCA) could be used even when the state statute lacked an element of the generic offense, so long as the Shepard documents showed that the defendant’s actual conduct satisfied that element.

This was a broad and controversial extension of the MCA. The Ninth Circuit described this as the “missing element” rule.

2. What Most Other Circuits Did

Other circuits generally held that the modified categorical approach cannot be used unless the statute is divisible—i.e., lists alternative elements, some of which match the generic crime and some of which do not.
If an element is simply absent from the statute (as with California § 459 lacking “unlawful entry”), the statute is categorically broader, and the inquiry ends.

Thus, the Ninth Circuit was an outlier.

3. Supreme Court Resolution in Descamps

In Descamps v. United States (2013), the Supreme Court directly rejected the Aguila-Montes approach. The Court held:

The modified categorical approach cannot be used to reconstruct missing elements.

It applies only to divisible statutes with alternative elements, not to statutes that are simply overbroad.

California burglary under § 459 categorically fails to qualify as “generic burglary” because it lacks the “unlawful entry” element.

This reversed the Ninth Circuit.

4. Result

Because Descamps is binding nationwide, the Ninth Circuit’s ruling in Aguila-Montes de Oca is no longer good law on this point.

Conclusion

The Ninth Circuit's ruling in Aguila-Montes de Oca allowing the modified categorical approach to supply a missing element in a non-divisible burglary statute was:

Contrary to the majority of circuits at the time, and

Explicitly rejected by the Supreme Court in Descamps.

Under current law, the modified categorical approach cannot be used when the statute lacks an element of the generic offense.",,,,,,

However, there are nuances to this principle, as explained below.","No, a case does not become moot under Article III simply because the lone plaintiff receives an offer from the defendants to satisfy all of the plaintiff's claims, if the offer is unaccepted. The U.S. Supreme Court held in *Campbell-Ewald Co. v.

The Court also left open the possibility that a case might become moot if the defendant deposits the full amount of the plaintiff's individual claim into an account payable to the plaintiff and the court enters judgment for the plaintiff in that amount, but this issue remains unresolved and has led to a split among lower courts (Practice notes, FRCP 68 Offers of Judgment)[1], (Practice notes, Rule 68 Offers of Judgment in Fair Labor Standards Act Collective Actions)[3], (Practice notes, TILA Litigation: Key Issues and Considerations)[4], (Practice notes, TCPA Litigation: Key Issues and Considerations)[5]. For example, some courts have held that payment into the court's registry under FRCP 67 does not moot the claim, while others have suggested that actual payment directly to the plaintiff or a trusted intermediary might suffice (Practice notes, FRCP 68 Offers of Judgment)[1], (Practice notes, Rule 68 Offers of Judgment in Fair Labor Standards Act Collective Actions)[3], (Practice notes, TILA Litigation: Key Issues and Considerations)[4], (Practice notes, TCPA Litigation: Key Issues and Considerations)[5].

Thus, while an unaccepted offer alone does not moot a case, the implications of actual payment or deposit remain uncertain and vary by jurisdiction (Practice notes, FRCP 68 Offers of Judgment)[1], (Practice notes, Rule 68 Offers of Judgment in Fair Labor Standards Act Collective Actions)[3], (Practice notes, TILA Litigation: Key Issues and Considerations)[4], (Practice notes, TCPA Litigation: Key Issues and Considerations)[5].

Gomez, 577 U.S. 153. held that an unaccepted settlement offer, including one that purports to provide complete relief, does not moot a plaintiff's claim. The Court reasoned that an unaccepted offer is a ""legal nullity"" and does not extinguish the plaintiff's personal stake in the litigation. As long as the plaintiff retains a concrete interest in the outcome, the case remains a live controversy under Article III . Campbell-Ewald Co. v. Gomez, 577 U.S. 153, Lary v. Rexall Sundown, Inc., 686 Fed. Appx. 63. 

Additionally, the Court in   Genesis HealthCare Corp. v. Symczyk, 569 U.S. 66. acknowledged that merely receiving an offer does not moot a claim, as the plaintiff's rejection of the offer leaves the parties in the same adversarial position as when the case was filed . Genesis HealthCare Corp. v. Symczyk, 569 U.S. 66.  Similarly, in , Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85.  the Court emphasized that a case becomes moot only when it is impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief to the plaintiff, and a defendant cannot unilaterally moot a case by offering relief without the plaintiff's acceptance . Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85. 

Circuit courts have also consistently rejected the argument that an unaccepted offer of complete relief moots a claim. For example, the Second Circuit in   Geismann v. ZocDoc, Inc., 909 F.3d 534. reiterated that an unaccepted offer does not render a claim moot, as the plaintiff retains a personal stake in the litigation . Geismann v. ZocDoc, Inc., 909 F.3d 534.  Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit in   Chen v. Allstate Ins. Co., 819 F.3d 1136. held that a lawsuit remains live unless the plaintiff actually receives all the relief sought, not merely an offer of such relief . Mote v. Wilkie, 976 F.3d 1337. 

In conclusion, under prevailing Supreme Court and circuit court precedents, an unaccepted offer to satisfy all of a plaintiff's claims does not moot the case, as the plaintiff retains a personal stake in the litigation until actual relief is provided or the claim is otherwise resolved .

 Campbell-Ewald Co. v. Gomez, 577 U.S. 153, Lary v. Rexall Sundown, Inc., 686 Fed. Appx. 63, Geismann v. ZocDoc, Inc., 909 F.3d 534.

### Current rule (as generally applied):

A case becomes moot only if:

1. **The plaintiff actually receives complete relief**, *and*
2. **Nothing remains in dispute**, *and*
3. **The court can order no additional effective relief.**

An *offer*, without acceptance and without entry of judgment granting full relief, fails these requirements.",,,,,,
